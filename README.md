# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Brief Description
Our project is a task management web application designed to help users organize and keep track of their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or incomplete. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily manage their tasks, prioritize them, and stay organized. With features like task filtering, users can quickly find the tasks they are looking for based on their status. Our goal is to simplify task management and enhance productivity for individuals and teams

##Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

##Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone. ["https://github.com/csgowtham/ZenClass_React_ToDo_TaskList_CRUD_Task-CSG.git"]
    - Navigate to the project directory.
    - Install dependencies by running npm install.
    - Run the project locally using npm start.

##Usage
To use the project:

        - Open the project in your preferred code editor.
        - Make any necessary configurations or customizations.
        - Start the development server using npm start.
        - Access the project in your web browser.

##Features
       - This project includes the following features:
       - User authentication system
       - CRUD functionality for managing tasks
       - Responsive design for various screen sizes
       - Integration with external APIs
       - Search and filter functionality for tasks
       - Customizable user settings and preferences

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
